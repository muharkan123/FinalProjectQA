## Cypress Automation for QA Bootcamp Final Project

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Final Project Repository for SanberCode QA Bootcamp! ðŸš€

This repository showcases my final project, a culmination of all the skills and techniques I've mastered during the SanberCode QA Bootcamp. It's designed to highlight the power of Cypress, one of the most popular frameworks for end-to-end testing in modern web applications.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a fully automated testing suite built using Cypress, demonstrating the ability to:

    - Write robust test cases for critical user workflows.
    - Automate end-to-end tests with dynamic assertions.
    - Utilize the Page Object Model (POM) for better test maintainability.
    - Handle test data efficiently for data-driven testing scenarios.
    - Integrate CI/CD pipelines to ensure seamless testing workflows.
